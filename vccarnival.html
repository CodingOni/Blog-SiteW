          <p>Though spring officially begins on March 20th,  if you ever need a reminder that it’s just around the corner, look no further than the VC Carnaval. Yesterday the French Champagne house, Veuve Clicquot held it’s annual carnival-themed event at Museum Park overlooking Biscayne Bay in Downtown Miami.</p>     
         
          <p>For us, there was a mix-up at the gate that nearly soured the day. The guards claimed that we couldn’t bring in food. Odd. This is a picnic style event and it has always been. The publicity for the event and the official website clearly stated that food was permitted. Of course, there were some exceptions like coolers and outside alcohol but we had none of the aforementioned. After conferring with management, it turns out the guards were misinformed. They apologized and let us and several other guests through with their items, but this was after we had already begun unpacking and preparing to toss items. Luckily we didn’t but it was a major inconvenience nonetheless. I hope the VC staff provides clearer instructions for their staff going forward.</p>
          <p>With that kerfuffle behind us, once we entered the event, it was smooth sailing. The event buzzed with well-dressed attendees in search of a bubbly-filled good time as the South American musical influence set the tone for the day. The bright center stage came alive with live music and dancing from renowned performance group, Swing Latino that brought the crowd to their feet. When they weren’t bringing down the house, DJ May Kwok played tunes that kept the party going.</p>
         <p>Overall, the VC Carnaval was once again a good time and a recommended event for anyone who loves champagne, posh picnics and partaking in the pleasures of people watching. Not surprisingly, it’s also great for networking. The people are in great moods and feeling friendly unlike some of your typical professional networking events. But the best part for me, besides getting dressed up myself, just might be the people watching. Attendees arrived dressed to the nines. And it wasn't just the ladies who make it a point to be fashion forward. The gents, oh the gents really pulled it together and it was a sight to see.</p>
         <p>Want to ensure you don’t miss out on the next VC Carnaval? Be sure to follow Veuve Clicquot on social media or check back with vccarnaval.com for updates. For reference, this year’s Carnaval had two pricing levels. Tickets for the newly launched Rose Garden section went for $350 each, and general admission tickets sold for $45 (up from $35 from the previous year). Naturally, I would expect prices to change again in 2019. However, if next year seems like just too long to wait for the next Veuve Cliquot event, the champagne house does hold several other events during the year. Try the VC Polo Classic, which is typically held in New York in June or the Los Angeles Polo Classic, which is usually held in October.</p>
