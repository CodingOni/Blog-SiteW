          <p>Bali, has been calling my name for years now. There was something about this picturesque, spiritual looking place that I knew I had to explore. I sold my usual travel buddy, E on it and this year we finally made it happen. As I told friends and coworkers about my intended visit to this far away land they all oozed with envy, some recounting stories of their own visits. I heard tales of sunrise treks up volcanoes and $4(USD) massages. I could not wait.</p>

          <p>About a week prior to our trip, while in Toronto for Caribana, a friend sent me a news link about a deadly earthquake on Lombok Island in Indonesia, Bali’s large neighboring island to the east. I started to think maybe I just had bad luck when it came to vacationing. I can literally recount a hospitalization, a death in the family, back-to-back hurricanes and a terrorist attack happening days or mere hours before major vacations. One of those actually happened during the actual trip (2 hurricanes barreled towards Hawaii narrowly missing us in the end).</p>

          <p>As death tolls began to rise, we were rattled and unsure of what to do. After some research we discovered that Bali is located in what’s known as the Ring of Fire (WTF), a name it acquired because of the prevalence of volcanoes and fault lines. Sooo... in Indonesia earthquakes are just a thing I guess. In light of this discovery and the recent uptick in fault activity, E and I decided to not risk it and cancel Bali. Maybe we could go to Greece instead. We’d purchased travel insurance so we assumed this would be easy. Wrong. There were no US travel restrictions or advisories placed on Bali and the Balinese government had deemed Bali safe for travel so refunds for our tickets were a no-go. What would we do? “I guess we’re going to Bali” said E and that’s what we did.</p>

          <p>I flew into New York to meet with E and we flew out of JFK on EVA air. I loathe long flights so I prepared for the worst. Surprisingly, our 30-hour flight wasn’t that bad. Service was great and we lucked out with comfortable seats with plenty of legroom. I slept for a good majority of the first leg of the trip. Even our 5-layover in Taipei Taiwan went by pretty smoothly. Taipei’s airport is probably the coolest airport I’ve ever been in. Each terminal decked out in its own unique theme made the building seem more like a museum than a travel hub.</p>

          <p>We landed in Bali around 3pm and were immediately awed by Denpasar airport, which resembled an Asian botanical garden. We were greeted by our hotel rep and set off to Poppies, our hotel in Kuta. This would be the first village stop on our stay. On the trek to the hotel I realized that Bali was more than the picturesque rice fields and temples I regularly saw on the web and Instagram. It was a real place with real indigenous people living real lives. Simple and sometimes rundown buildings were home to bare minimum storefronts and homes. Stray dogs roamed the streets and scores of mopeds zigzagged through congested traffic. It was loud, bustling and chaotic. As we got closer to our hotel it became touristier. Eateries, hotels and shops with American brands like Nike in the window were visible but the gritty realness of the village couldn’t be completely masked. These were simple people and it almost felt like we (tourists) were intruding.</p>
          
          <p>Our hotel was hidden down a narrow street that was barely wide enough for mopeds but even cars defiantly squeezed through with little regard for pedestrians. We quickly learned that walking in Bali meant move or be moved. It was raining as we checked into our hotel, which was made up of several cottages and a covered outdoor reception area. We figured we would get washed up, take a nap and head out for dinner. We stuck to the first part of the plan but our bodies missed the memo on part two. When we awakened and realized it was pouring outside and that we weren’t all that hungry we decided to stay in bed and chalked up our first night in Bali to enjoying our cute little cottage and getting some much needed rest.</p>
          
          <p>We had a full day of activities planned the next day. Breakfast, a trek down to Nusa Dua for water activities, a visit cliff side to the Uluwatu Temple and sunset dance, followed by dinner. We had a glutinous breakfast at this cute little café where the fresh, mixed juice was to die for. We ordered fresh juice almost everywhere we went after that.</p>
          
          <p>Veering from plan we decided to do a little wandering. We walked in and out of local shops, wandered onto to the beach and even stopped so E could get a henna tattoo. We headed back to our hotel and hired a diver to Nusa Dua. On the drive we saw a structure that seemed to tower over the island. Turns out it’s one of the biggest monuments in the world. Located at Garuda Wisnu Kencana Cultural Park, the giant statue of Hindu God Vishnu is depicted riding a Garuda mystical bird. The statue, 28 years in the making, apparently had just been completed this April. Our diver mentioned we could stop by on our return. Vishnu stands approximately 396 ft. high. For perspective, the Statue of Liberty is approximately 305 ft. high. We ran long at the activity center and didn’t get a chance to go back, which in retrospect was a shame. Much like Christ the Redeemer in Brazil or the Statue of Liberty in New York, It seems like a spectacular, cultural must-see.</p>
          
          <p>We arrived at the activity center and after some indecisiveness decided on the water jet bike and underwater sea walking. I absolutely sucked at the water bike. I could barely get off the water and when I fell, I fell hard, but the few times I did manage to get off the water, it was exhilarating. E fared much better and had a good time laughing at me.</p>
          
          <p>Next we headed off with two employees on a small motorboat equipped with a single life vest (I held on extra tight) and arrived at a stationed boat further out in the water. They gave us a few instructions and down we went. Not gonna lie I was a bit scared but once I climbed down the ladder I was at ease, fully immersed in the beauty of the sea. From the coral to the fish and the underwater statues, it was a great experience. We headed back and got cleaned up and waited while they put our pictures on a CD. By the time we got back in the car and set off again it was already late and traffic was crazy. Our driver told us the sun would be setting in a few minutes and we would miss the sunset at Uluwatu Temple. That was a huge bummer for me, I really wanted to visit that temple and in retrospect would have made sure to spend a little less time wandering aimlessly through Kuta. We decided to just go straight to dinner. For dinner we visited Jimbaran Bay, which we heard was great for seafood. Jimbaran is all about ambiance. Candle-lit tables stretched out across the beach as far as the eye could see. Several restaurants featured live music and performances. I ordered a fried salmon and I forget what type of grilled fish E ordered but we each got these massive whole fish. E was not so impressed by her dish but mine was delicious.</p>
          
          <p>After dinner we headed back to our hotel to call it a night. However, for some reason we were wired. We decided to head out and see if any of those 4-dollar massage places were open (it was after 10:30pm). After a couple of unsuccessful attempts, we decided to walk down another busy looking street and voila we found an open spot. 1 hour massage 60,000 rupiah. Perfect! We got great massages and headed back to our room.</p>
          
          <p>The next morning our driver from our next hotel picked us up bright and early. On the way, we spotted a large group of men running and inquired about what they were doing and he said some fighting training. I thought he asked us if we had ever attended a fight and mentioned stopping to see one. When I realized we were ahead of schedule, I said why not. What he ended up taking us to was temple where we stopped to take photos and attended a live play-like performance. We took in some of the show but realized if we stayed much longer we would not make it to the hotel on schedule to meet our next driver. We found our driver (he was doing some “window shopping at an adjacent market) and continued on to our hotel.</p>
          
          <p>The drive was scenic. We got to see the contrast of lush green terrains, congested streets and massive religious monuments. Bali’s culture is truly driven by its religion. The majority of people are of the Hindu faith. Everywhere you go you’ll witness people placing offerings at the foot of entryways. The offerings typically consist of a small, handcrafted leaf basket filled with flowers and other gifts and is toped with incense. The Balinese create these offerings as selfless gifts to the gods. It’s important to be mindful not to step on or kick them especially while the incense is burning.</p>
          
          <p>We arrived at our hotel, Villa Flow about 15-20 minutes later than planned. Our driver was patiently waiting for us. The hotel was quite unassuming. Hidden behind a concrete wall, I wondered if we were even in the right place but as we entered through the gates and crossed the threshold I realized this was exactly where we were meant to be. The view from the entry of the property was absolutely breathtaking. A large, open area lead down to the infinity-edge pool, which overlooked the ocean and mountains ahead. Tucked off to the side was the lobby. We were greeted by hotel staff and the property owner, David who sat us down, offered us refreshments and chatted us up for a few.</p>
          
          <p>We were shown to our “room” (That’s in quotations because room was an understatement). The structure we stayed in was more like a 2-floor cottage crafted in a beautiful dark wood. The exterior of the first floor featured a patio with dinning table and lounge chairs. The interior could serve as a living room or sleeping quarters for two with its own bathroom and sink area. Upstairs was the master bedroom, beautifully designed as well with a white mosquito net draped romantically over the bed.</p>
          
          <p>As we chatted and got our things in order in our room before heading out with our driver something happened. All of the sudden our cottage moved. Yes I said it moved. It wasn’t so much as a tremble it was more of a quick sway almost as if a tremendously strong gust of wind was pushing to and fro. “What the fuck is that?” I thought to myself.</p>

              </a>

          <p>Now where did we leave off? Ah yes, our cottage just moved. I would describe the look on both of our faces as a combination of fear and WTF. As our cottage swayed back and forth and the structure made creaking sounds, our eyes met and we spoke to each other with them. Without words, we both asked each other what the hell was going on. There’s no way a gust of wind could be that strong. I walked onto the room’s balcony and started towards the stairs with the full intention of making a run for my life once I was truly convinced this was an earthquake. Just as I did that, it all stopped. Beyond the hotel’s surrounding trees I could hear dogs barking, cows mooing, and roosters crowing. The animals had concerns and so did we.</p>

          <p>I walked back into the room and looked at E when she verbally asked the question we had both been asking each other with our eyes just seconds ago, “What the hell was that?” “ I don’t know” I replied. “We have to ask them what that was.” she added. I knew in my gut what it was but for some reason I didn’t want to jump to conclusions.</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

          <p>We were still unpacking when room service brought us lunch. We ate quickly then walked out to meet our driver, Gede. Gede was a short, stalky man with a warm spirit. As we hopped in the back of the car, he turned and energetically asked if we had felt the earthquake. “Yes, OH MY GOD! That was an earthquake?” we both boisterously exclaimed. What really struck us was that no one at the hotel mentioned anything. The staff didn’t even come check on us. In contrast, they escorted us to Gede’s car and told us to have a great time as if... as if the earth didn’t just friggin’ move. Seriously? WTF? He told us that a pretty large earthquake had once again hit the island of Lombok. But Gede didn’t seem at all concerned and neither did anyone else. If they weren’t worried about it, I guess we wouldn’t be either. All we could do was relax and enjoy our day. Earthquakes in Bali are a thing.</p>
          
          <p>Our first stop with Gede was Temple Pura Lempuyung. You may not know this temple by name but have likely seen images of it’s famous gateway, often tagged as The Gates of Heaven or Heaven's Gate, on Instagram. The temple’s structure features a strategic opening, which aligns with the island’s largest volcano, Mount Agung. If you’re lucky enough to visit on a clear day, you can view the top of the volcano through the opening of the gate. This makes for a breathtaking photo and to most, that’s what this temple is known for, this stunning image. In some photos it looks as if the gates sit on the edge of some type of body of water where a reflection of the gate and visitors can be seen in the water. It’s a great photo but sadly it’s an optical illusion. There was no water at Lempuyung, save for the small rain puddle at the base of the gate. The photographer achieves this reflective effect by placing a mirror under the camera’s lens.</p>
          
          <p>What’s also worth noting is that outside of the locals, this temple was not too long ago a hidden gem. Located in East Bali in the district of Karangasem, it’s far removed from the hustle and bustle of places like Kuta and even Ubud but it seems as though it’s Instagram popularity has helped change that. It’s safe to say that Temple Pura Lempuyung is now a popular tourist attraction.</p>
          
          <p>We arrived and at the entrance where we were prompted to give a small donation. We were then given sarongs and wraps to put on. All visitors must wear sarongs and shoulders must be covered. We walked up a hill passing a couple of merchants on the way. At the temple’s first level, where the gates are located, was a large group of people waiting in line for an opportunity to take THE picture. As a group of people moved, E slid in place behind another. I’m pretty sure we skipped some folks but whatever. It was hot. It was scorching hot.</p>
          
          <p>When the locals responsible for directing the flow of tourist traffic tried to reorganize the line in a manner, which surely would have meant losing our spot, E refused to move. A group of people visiting as a part of a tour, had apparently been there over an hour and complained about the adjustment but we lucked out. Gede was apparently friends with the organizers and told them to look out for us. Gotta love Gede. </p>
          
          <p>We hurried up to take our photos and each got a couple of shots in before attempting to take some shots together but at that point my phone ran out of memory. Gede had his boys let us go back up to reshoot. I could feel the hateful glares on the back of my neck as we ran back into position at the gate. Oh honey, they wanted off with our heads. The crowd screamed and protested as we ran back up. Gede’s friend retook our photos and we got out of the way before things got too ugly. We took a couple of photos on the other side of the temple at the sculpted stairs before leaving. We had hoped to get up to a couple of other levels of the temple. There are 7 in total and the views of the island from the top are said to be spectacular but it was unbelievably hot, the hike is not for the faint of heart and E wanted no parts of it. Pro tip: if you ever plan on visiting, be sure to get there early to avoid the lines and the sun and save some energy for the temple’s other levels even if you don’t make it to all 7 of them.</p>
          
          <p>Our next stop was Taman Tirta Grangga, AKA the water palace. The water palace was just as beautiful and serene as I pictured. Large ponds and sculptures filled the space. The main pond featured stepping-stones, which created a path from one end of the pond to the other. The ponds were filled with fish. Gede purchased some fish food for us and we were able to entertain ourselves feeding the different pond fish.</p>
          
          <p>Like our previous stop, the water palace was filled with tourists. However, this group seemed to actually be enjoying the moment. Young and old frolicked around the steeping-stone pond with smiles from ear to ear. Distracted by the surroundings, E stepped on the back of my foot popping my sandal and forcing me to hobble around the garden before she used a rubberband to hold it together (Yeah it was ghetto). I had to borrow her sandals to frolic for photos because the struggle was real. Gede took a couple of pictures for us and we wandered around, stumbling upon some areas of the garden that were under construction as well as an attached restaurant and hotel.</p>
          
          <p>As we exited the gardens a couple wearing some very ornate Balinese garments entered. The garments sparkled with intricate beading and both of their faces were heavily made up. I assume they’d just gotten married and turns out I was right. From their regal gold crowns, to the bride’s accordion fan (carried like a western bridal bouquet) and the groom’s sword (carried as a symbol of his role as protector), they were beautiful. I snapped a couple of photos and we left the park and visited some merchants just outside the garden’s entrance. This is where E decided to take a photo with a snake. Good for her. I passed on that photo opp.</p>
          
          <p>We found Gede at the coffee shop across the street chopping it up with his friends. We told him to finish his coffee but he refused. We hoped in the car again and a short while later declared we were hungry. “Oh why didn’t you tell me?” he exclaimed. “I know a very nice place”. He turned the car around and took us to a surreal spot called, Warung Shanti. The quant restaurant overlooked a picturesque rice field. There we had a tasty lunch and our usual Balinese mixed juices.</p>
          
          <p>As we ate this great meal, I noticed there were workers present in the rice field. With my plate full of rice I couldn’t help but think about the contrast of this picture: My swanky vacation in the foreground and their backbreaking labor in the background; We westerners living it up and them just making a living. Oddly, in this beautiful setting, I was more mesmerized by the people than the landscape.</p>

          <p>We finished up and headed back to the hotel. We tried to schedule a massage but no one was on duty. We went for a swim as the sun set and lounged by the pool. We showered and got into relaxation mode. Our room had been turned down and mosquito netting pulled down for the evening. E received a call from a friend and they discussed the earlier earthquake and possible safety measures in case of future quakes. I chatted with some friends who had also heard about the quakes and this did nothing but raise my anxiety as the “mom” of the group urged - no, commanded me to get on the first flight out. We called it a night super early only to be awakened in the middle of the night by a tremor. Startled, we both woke up. I began “Is that a ...” E interrupted “yes”. We fought through the damn mosquito net to find openings like mad women and hopped out of the bed as fast as we could. We stood under a support beam and held on for dear life and once again all of mother natures animals continued to loose their shit.</p>
          
          <p>Along with the jungle hysterics was some sort of weird, steal drum-knocking sound. Was this the equivalent to a wind chime? Was this an earthquake chime? Within seconds it was over but this happened two more times during the night. The third time, the tremor stopped before I could fight my way out of the mosquito net. In retrospect, I have no clue why we didn’t put that damn thing up or to the side. Who cares about mosquito bites if you’re about to die? I’m sure we looked like complete asses trying to find the opening every time.</p>
          
          <p>It was a long night but we made it through and the next morning decided to enjoy our hotel before our next driver picked us up to head to Ubud. We had a great breakfast and luxuriated in the pool.</p>
          
          <p>As we left we ran into David who had lots to say about earthquakes and volcanoes. Apparently, he geeks out over this stuff and thoroughly enjoys it. He grinned from ear to ear as he pulled out a seismograph chart to show us all of the recent activity, Smh.</p>
          
          <p>You can keep it David. I loved the hotel but I couldn’t say that I was all that sad to leave. Not that we wouldn’t have felt the tremors in Ubud but at least we wouldn’t be near the shore and have to worry about earthquakes AND tsunamis. Off to Ubud we went.</p>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

          <p>Our next stop in Bali was Ubud. Ubud is known as the cultural heart of Bali. The pace was busier and more crowded than Karangasem but slower and less crowded than Kuta. Ubud was the perfect way to end our time in Bali. I loved the mix of tourist friendly activities and authentic Bali sights.</p> 
          <p>We pulled up to the gated entrance of our hotel, Soulshine Bali in the early afternoon. Another nondescript entrance opened up to expansive lush grounds. We chose Soulshine Bali because of its cool factor. It looked so laidback and calming. Pictures of Bob Marley and Jimmy Hendrix were prominently on display. I felt like if they were alive, this would definitely be a place they would hang out. The hotel caters to yogi types and often holds yoga retreats. I’m a novice when it comes to yoga and E isn’t really into it at all but we both loved the vibe. Even the pathway up to the main lobby was welcoming with messages like “inhale” and exhale, displayed in the stone-paved walkway.</p>
          <p>We were greeted with refreshments on arrival and had a seat while we checked in. Our driver was waiting for us so we could head out for the activity we had lined up for the day, which was Bali Swing.</p>
          <p>I’d seen Bali Swing on Instagram and looked it up on Trip Advisor. While it looked beautiful from what I’d seen, none of the pictures I’d seen did it justice. I expected to see a single swing amidst some beautiful lush greenery but what we saw was more like a swing park. After paying for admission we went down a level into the jungle where you could see the multiple swing stations that spanned throughout the large property, some of them scarier than others. Also sprinkled throughout the property where photo stations. Many of them fashioned to look like giant birds nests. We headed to our first swing and waited in line. The swing attendants pushed us into a full swing and shouted instructions on which way to look to capture the perfect picture. Afterwards we stopped at a couple of photo stations before heading further down into the jungle for lunch.</p>
          <p>Our driver told us to make sure we took advantage of the lunch, which was included in the admission. The employees were also adamant about reminding us to take advantage of the complimentary lunch as well. We made our way down a couple of long flights of stairs and across a roped bridge to the lunch area, which was positioned next to a small waterfall and river. The scenery down there was a wonderful surprise. I thought we were headed to some kind of cafeteria for lunch. We weren’t expecting the view to be this nice. E at this point, was developing a killer headache so we had lunch and then relaxed in the loungers facing the river for a while.</p>
          <p>We went back up to the swing area where we enjoyed some other swings and I tried my hand at one of the scarier ones. Most of the swings had a little safety cord but for this larger one they actually harness you in with a legit safety harness. Bali Swing turned out to be an all day activity and it was getting dark and approaching closing time by the time we left. We headed back to the hotel and had dinner there before retiring for the evening. E’s headache had gotten worse and she really wasn’t up for anything else.</p>
          <p>The following day was full of planned adventures. We woke up at about 5 am to catch the sunrise in the outdoor, rooftop yoga room and then had an expectedly healthy but surprisingly delicious breakfast. After breakfast we went up to get massages. The massages were great but there wasn’t much time following them to luxuriate and settle into relax mode. Our driver was waiting. We wanted to visit the massive Tegalalang rice terraces and Mason Elephant Manor.</p>
          <p>Before we started our activities we stopped at a woodwork shop so I could get some wooden souvenirs. I started collecting woodwork as vacation souvenirs a couple of trips back. Along the route we also stopped at various roadside shops looking for an elephant piece that E wanted. We didn’t find it but just looking for it was rather fun.</p>
          <p>Before going to Mason Elephant Manor we decided to stop at the coffee plantation to get some practical souvenirs for our parents. The driver parked and we told him we shouldn’t be more than 30 minutes since we had no intention of taking the tour but once again, this attraction was not what we expected. I expected to see a small building with an attached shop that maybe sat on some farming land. Once we got there however, we were in awe. The coffee plantation was massive. To our surprise, it also had swings. But wait there’s more! There was also zip lining. What? Zip lining? Sign us up. Naturally, we got in line and went zip lining. I think we were at the coffee plantation for about two hours. So much for 30 minutes.</p>
          <p>We met our driver and embarrassingly stated that we thought we would be 30 minutes but we didn’t know what we were walking into. We decided to go straight to the elephant park and passed the rice terrace on the way hoping we’d get a chance to stop there on the way back.</p>
          <p>Getting to the elephant park was crazy. I swear, I once again saw my life flash before my eyes. Our driver decided to take some dirt cliff-side road to get there. First of all...to enter the road he had to squeeze through a narrow gate. I should have known we were in trouble when a guy got off his scooter to help guide him through.</p>
          <p>We started down the makeshift road, which hugged a mountainside to the right and overlooked a cliff to the left, testing the roads limits in a van on a road obviously meant for small vehicles and bikes. We crawled along at snail speeds to avoid falling off the cliff and into the jungle below. I was hyper vigilant as I clutched onto the door handle for dear life. All I could think of was what if another earthquake struck at this exact moment. Of course that would mean certain death. “Are we going the right way?” I asked. He confirmed we were. “Is this the only way?” I nervously questioned again. Surely this couldn’t be the only way to get to a major tourist attraction. At that point I think he understood and felt my terror and assured me he would take a different route on the way back, which he did. In the end we made it to the park and back in one piece.</p>
          <p>The elephant park was a great experience. We chatted it up with one of the trainers as we took an elephant ride. When we asked what would happen in the case of an earthquake, the trainer responded that the elephants panic. “Oh fucking great,” I thought, as we sat on the back of one. I can picture it now, “Tourists thrown off elephant and trampled by other elephants during an earthquake-incited elephant stampede. Story at ten.” Get me off this elephant.</p>
          <p>We finished the ride and took a moment to feed and take playful pictures with some of the others elephants. Afterwards we listened to the presentation and watched some of the elephants bathe before leaving.</p>
          <p>We then had dinner at a local restaurant. The scenery as the sun set was beautiful and the food was delicious. As we left, E slipped the young waitress who had snapped a photo for us earlier, a generous tip and she beamed with excitement as she hurriedly walked away. We never made it to Tegalalang, which was unfortunate but luckily we saw a number of smaller rice fields during our stay including the one that our hotel sat on.</p>
          <p>Our driver took us back to the hotel. We quickly showered and met him back at the car so we could head to the center of town and get massages. But um... this time our massage was a little different than the ones we had experienced before. First we got scolded for laughing too loudly in the room and then it took quiet a while for my guy to come in and get started. For some reason, E’s masseuse was extra loud. I literally heard every thing he was doing to her and since they worked in near unison, I wondered if I would be experiencing whatever she was experiencing next. Fortunately I didn’t. Turns out he was extra rough with her. In her words “he beat me up”. We died at the hilarity of it all.</p>
          <p>We made it back to the room for a short rest. We had an early flight in the morning. We were leaving for the airport around 4:30 am to head off to our next adventure. Off to Singapore we go.</p>

That was an earthquake?” we both boisterously exclaimed. What really struck us was that no one at the hotel mentioned anything. The staff didn’t even come check on us. In contrast, they escorted us to Gede’s car and told us to have a great time as if... as if the earth didn’t just friggin’ move. Seriously? WTF? He told us that a pretty large earthquake had once again hit the island of Lombok. But Gede didn’t seem at all concerned and neither did anyone else.">
