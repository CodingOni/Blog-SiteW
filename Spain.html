          <p>We bid farewell to Barcelona and boarded the train to Seville. Thankfully, this time boarding was a far more civilized experience and involved no running. We arrived in Seville and I immediately fell in love. Seville is exactly the type of place you think of when you think of Spain. I was captivated by its picturesque old-worldliness. </p>
        
          <p>Our cab pulled up on a long a narrow, cobble stone road where he let us out. Our hotel, Casa del Poeta was tucked in a hard-to-find corner. At the entrance were big, antique, double doors with a threshold you had to step over to enter. Inside, the ambiance was charming and the staff was equally so. The desk attendees rushed over to help us in and sat us down at a table in the courtyard where they served us complimentary drinks and light snacks while they checked us in. One look at our room and we were gushing at its cuteness. It was easily our favorite hotel (property and room) out of all four we stayed at during our time in Spain. </p>
        
          <p>After checking in we went out exploring for a spot to eat lunch. This however, was during peak siesta time so pickings were slim at the open kitchens. Luckily, we did find something and what we were able to pick from the limited offerings was delish.</p>
          
          <p>We ventured over near the Royal Alcazar and witnessed a newly wed couple taking photos. Through some further exploration, we stumbled on the best ice cream I’ve ever had in my life. We went back to the room and dressed for dinner and explored some more before having dinner at another picturesque spot. </p>

          <p>For day two we booked a non-refundable morning tour of the Royal Alcazar. This was probably the one place that I was looking forward to visiting most on the entire trip. So did something go wrong? Well, given our track record, you can bet it did. Yup, we overslept. We missed the tour. Like by hours. </p>
          
          <p>I walked back into the room and looked at E when she verbally asked the question we had both been asking each other with our eyes just seconds ago, “What the hell was that?” “ I don’t know” I replied. “We have to ask them what that was.” she added. I knew in my gut what it was but for some reason I didn’t want to jump to conclusions.</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

          <p>The flamenco show, which was touted as one of the best places to view authentic flamenco, was held at the Flamenco Dance Museum. In a dark space formally used as a wine cellar, a three-person group danced together and performed solos as live musicians accompanied them. I thoroughly enjoyed it. E on the other hand, fell asleep part of the way through. Though, I’m not sure how with all the stomping. I was disappointed though that it wasn’t very interactive and we were not allowed to take pictures of or with the dancers but I improvised as the space emptied out to capture some moments of my own.</p>          
          
          <p>Our first stop with Gede was Temple Pura Lempuyung. You may not know this temple by name but have likely seen images of it’s famous gateway, often tagged as The Gates of Heaven or Heaven's Gate, on Instagram. The temple’s structure features a strategic opening, which aligns with the island’s largest volcano, Mount Agung. If you’re lucky enough to visit on a clear day, you can view the top of the volcano through the opening of the gate. This makes for a breathtaking photo and to most, that’s what this temple is known for, this stunning image. In some photos it looks as if the gates sit on the edge of some type of body of water where a reflection of the gate and visitors can be seen in the water. It’s a great photo but sadly it’s an optical illusion. There was no water at Lempuyung, save for the small rain puddle at the base of the gate. The photographer achieves this reflective effect by placing a mirror under the camera’s lens.</p>
          
          <p>Following the show we had dinner on the sidewalk of another quaint little spot as a street performer played guitar and serenaded passersby in Spanish. After dinner we wandered into a more modern part of town and it all of the sudden felt like a total time warp. We languished over the thought of having to leave in the morning. Our vacation was almost over, just one last stop. Madrid again in the morning.</p>          
          
          <p>We arrived and at the entrance where we were prompted to give a small donation. We were then given sarongs and wraps to put on. All visitors must wear sarongs and shoulders must be covered. We walked up a hill passing a couple of merchants on the way. At the temple’s first level, where the gates are located, was a large group of people waiting in line for an opportunity to take THE picture. As a group of people moved, E slid in place behind another. I’m pretty sure we skipped some folks but whatever. It was hot. It was scorching hot.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Last Day In Madrid</h2>

        
          <p>The train ride from Seville to Madrid was comfortable and in no time we were back in Madrid. This time we stayed in the center of town. We checked into the Only You hotel. It was another super cute hotel with a creative take on antique design. Old suitcases were stacked along walls and books lined the elevator like a mini moving library. For whatever reason, our room was upgraded. Though small, it was designed well. Maps of Madrid of yesteryear served as wallpaper and an adorable balcony overlooked the busy but small street below.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>
          <p>Once again we took advantage of the tour bus system and purchased tickets for the Madrid tour bus. We hopped on and off and made our way to the Palacio Real Madrid. From the moment we entered the courtyard I knew this place would be amazing. Walking through the courtyard we ran into a group of guys visiting from the states. They stopped us to request that we snap a photo of them and suddenly we were cracking jokes on each other. We parted ways and visited the accessible rooms of the palace. Every room was breathtaking. The ceilings captivated me with their ornate paintings and the grand dining room overflowed with opulence. I couldn’t help but wonder what it would have been like to experience riches like these during the times of these former kings and queens.</p>
          <p>We ran into the same group of gentlemen on the way out. Once again we cracked jokes. Actually, it was mostly the guys insinuating that we were following them (as if).</p>          
          <p>Next we went to the Temple of Debod, an ancient Egyptian temple that was dismantled and rebuilt in Madrid. From the temple, we headed to Plaza Mayor. We spotted a sign for cheap tacos at a place called el Chaparrito so we went in. The tacos were friggin amazing. We devoured them whole before deciding to explore the rest of the area. We walked through the adjacent Market Mercado de San Miguel and stopped for ice cream at a nearby shop.</p>
          <p>After taking a selfie video in the square’s center at Plaza Mayor we heard some familiar voices. It was the guys from Palacio Real Madrid. We joked some more about who was following who but this time we exchanged info and discussed possibly meeting up later. We kept in touch but were unsuccessful in coordinating a meet up. Shame, it probably would have been a good time. E and I, exhausted from all of our activities, decided to go for a nightcap and explore our hotel instead. That turned out to be a blast. We left a hilarious message for the guys (it was even more hilarious when we sobered up) and then called it a night.</p>
          <p>The next morning we went for a quick breakfast at a cozy spot down the block. As usual breakfast was cheap and tasty. And with that breakfast, our vacation was over. One last picture with the cute doorman at our hotel and we were off. Goodbye Spain. Thanks for having us.</p>

                      alt="“Yes, OH MY GOD! That was an earthquake?” we both boisterously exclaimed. What really struck us was that no one at the hotel mentioned anything. The staff didn’t even come check on us. In contrast, they escorted us to Gede’s car and told us to have a great time as if... as if the earth didn’t just friggin’ move. Seriously? WTF? He told us that a pretty large earthquake had once again hit the island of Lombok. But Gede didn’t seem at all concerned and neither did anyone else.">
