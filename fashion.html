            <h3>Get the Look: Trail Blazer </h3>
            <p>I thought I would be a great idea to get back into posting my favorite type of post, the outfit post. We’ll keep it short and sweet but here goes.</p>            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I’m always looking for great transitional pieces. As a busy professional who’s is also navigating an active social life is often a necessity to find pieces that you can style to be multifunctional.</p>
            <p>I find great joy in adapting a completely unexpected piece to work in a corporate setting and then wow in a social setting with a few minor edits.</p>
            <p>This outfit does just that. The top is a blazer by Vince Camuto, the jumper is from Fashion Nova and the bag is a little gem I picked up in Seville Spain. For work, I would button up the blazer and  cover up the cutouts in the midsection. If your jumper is free of mildly scandalous cutouts, leave it open for a more relaxed look. Time to hit happy hour with the girls? Quickly remove the blazer and make it just in time to take advantage of those 2-for-1 drink specials. Enjoy!</p>

                  <h3>Pink Tie Affair</h3>
                  <p>I'm at it again with the ties. I can't help it; I love them. There something about taking a masculine piece of apparel and making it sassy that I find super appealing. So I originally had the idea of sporting a tie with a fitted white shirtdress but upon thinking about it, I decided that maybe it wouldn't be a look that would work for work. I just pictured myself looking like I had slept over my boyfriends house and had just decided to walk around the office pants-less in his white dress shirt. Not the best visual for the workplace. So when I found this option from Armani Exchange I thought it would be a great alternative. As you know I love color, so I paired the flowy white dress with a pop of color by adding the super hot pink pumps and matching pink tie. A little silver bracelet and tie clip complete this part business, part fabulous look.</p>

              <h3>Get the Look: Trail Blazer </h3>
              <p>I got the idea to pair a pretty formal looking blazer with a less-formal ankle pant. I preferred this pairing to a skirt, which I thought might look a little too stuffy. I contrasted the white with the bold colored pants and accents of silver. I think it's an interesting cross between "I'm bold and fun" and "I'm serious about my business. A short tail in the back is reminiscent of an old formal tuxedo but this blazer is best suited for the risk-taking, business fashionista.</p>

              <h3>NU YOU Empowerment Brunch – What I Wore </h3>
              <p>For my outfit for the NU You Empowerment Brunch I decided to combine fun and flirty with classic and feminine. I had this dainty piece sitting in the back of my closet for a while now. When I heard about this event, I immediately thought this skater dress would be perfect. It’s got a vibe that says brunch in an old New York feel that’s a little bit Audrey Hepburn and a little Sarah Jessica Parker.</p>               
              <p>I turned down the traditional and turned up the memorable with not-so-subtle pops of pink, actually, hot pink. I love throwing a black and white outfit for a loop with the addition of a bold, unapologetic color. I borrowed the ribbon belt from another dress and can't quite remember where I picked up the little clutch but the contrast of these items and my pink shoes, and necklace against the black came together perfectly to create a nearly effortless ensemble that still demands attention.</p>
