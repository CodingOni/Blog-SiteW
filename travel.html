            <h3>Project One</h3>
            <p>I recently had the pleasure of completing Kevin Hart’s audiobook, I Can’t Make This Up: Life Lessons. Before I get into this review let me start with the following disclaimer: I am biased, outlandishly so. I absolutely adore Kevin Hart and his brand of comedy and if you ask me, it’s almost as if he could do no wrong. I’ve seen him live, I follow him on social media and I pull up footage of his old stand up routines whenever I’m in a bad mood and need to cheer myself up. I went in fully expecting a great book and that’s exactly what I got. Now let's get to the review.</p>
            <button class="collapsible btn btn-primary">Open Collapsible</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>The narrator was Kevin himself (It would have been a crime if it had been anyone else). Kevin takes you through the chronological journey of his life, painting a vivid picture of what it was like to grow up as a poor kid from Philadelphia with a father only a son could love and a near militant mother who wanted nothing more but to provide for and protect her children. Kevin recalls moments from his youth so preposterous its impossible not to find the comedy in the sheer ludicrousness of each tale.</p>
    <p>For example, early on in the book Kevin describes a time when his father lost a game of basketball to Kevin’s older brother. Not only did he not take the loss very well, he proceeded to sic a dog on his sons as if to gain retribution for the loss before breaking down in laughter, berating the kids for being afraid and then claiming that the dog was actually harmless (it was much funnier when Kevin told it).</p>
    <p>From discovering his father was a drug addict, to his early days in comedy to the influences and mentors throughout his career, readers and listeners get a fly-on-the-wall perspective of so many of the life events that have coincided to shape the hardworking comedian and businessman we all know today.</p>
    <p>Aside from simply being a story about his life, I Can’t Make This Up is a refreshingly-motivational reminder to keep on going in the face of adversity. It becomes clear that Kevin owes much of his present-day success to his ability to persevere despite countless obstacles on his path to success. He calls it his ability to shoulder shrug.</p>
    <p>Throughout Kevin doles out sound advice and gives his perspective on overcoming life’s challenges and sums it up with the eight specific qualities that put him a position to win:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Persistence</li>
        <li>Patience</li>
        <li>Class</li>
        <li>Commitment</li>
        <li>Learning</li>
        <li>Passion-Centered Competitiveness</li>
        <li>Discomfort</li>
        <li>Positivity</li>

                  <p>Have you ever wondered what makes people stick it out? Why is it that some people are seemingly unaffected by failures and or obstacles? What is the super power that urges someone to dust themselves off and keep going in circumstances where most of us would likely call it quits? Well, the super power isn’t much of a super power after all. According to author Angela Duckworth, it all boils down to a character trait called grit.</p>
                  <button class="collapsible btn btn-primary">Open Collapsible</button>
      <div class="content">
          <p>What is grit? Angela defines grit as passion and perseverance for very long term goals. Essentially, grit is living life like it’s a marathon not a sprint. Duckworth starts the writing with a personal account of her achievement-obsessed father telling her “You’re no genius”. Though she doesn’t describe him as particularly mean spirited or ill intentioned, she does paint him as someone who heavily valued talent, much like our own society does today. We often give recognition to effort but are far more impressed by talent.</p>
          <p>As a teacher, she noted that her strongest students weren’t all ways the ones with the higher IQs. IQ proved not to be the determining factor in who would be her best or worst performers. She discovered that it wasn’t necessarily the most talented students, but the students who put in the most effort who excelled.</p>
          <p>Duckworth set out to answer the question, who’s successful and why? After leaving the classroom to pursue a graduate degree, she began studying children and adults in various types of challenging settings. Her subjects included teachers and students of struggling schools, West Point cadets and young finalist in the National Spelling Bee.</p>
          <p>I found her analysis of the West Point cadets to be particularly poignant. When you think of these cadets you automatically think that they must be top tier in terms of physical strength and intellect in order to complete the program, but oddly enough, some of the brightest and fittest end up dropping out and some give up on the program fairly early on.</p>
          <p>If you’ve been following my blog, you probably know that I love quotes. This book is the scientific illustration of one of my favorites, “Hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard.” There are many talented individuals who will never live up to the potential of their talents because they do not put in the effort. They don’t pursue that talent with enough passion to persevere when the pursuit of that talent becomes difficult.</p>
          <p>As Angela puts it, effort counts twice where talent counts once. She even outlines a formula to prove it.</p>
          <p>The optimistic aspect of this book is that Duckworth’s studies show that while we don’t all have grit, we can all grow grit. She outlines a 4-part method for that as well.</p>
          <ol>
              <li><b>Persistence</b>– Develop a fascination for the thing that you’re trying to accomplish</li>
              <li><b>Practice</b>– Focus on the daily improvements that will help you reach the goal</li>
              <li><b>Purpose</b> – Continuously remind yourself of the greater purpose</li>
              <li><b>Hope</b> – Apply a growth mindset. You did well.  How can you do better?</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Overall, the audio book was a good listen. Typically, there are two signs of a good audio book for me. One is when I’m regularly placing it on pause to make note of what was just said. I love books that make me want to take notes, where things jump out at me that I know I’ll want to remember later. The second sign is that the book leaves me feeling inspired. If it doesn’t make me want to take notes, it has to make me feel inspired.</p>
          <p>I didn’t really stop to take note while reading Grit. I’m not sure if it was because the premise seemed too obvious. The people who reach their goals are the people who don’t give up. Simple right?  Duckworth’s breakdown of her studies was enlightening but it was almost as if the book kept repeating the same thing. “It’s not the smartest or the most skilled that reach success but those with the most grit. I can say that I did find it to be inspiring. It helped reaffirm that whatever I thought was weighing against me didn’t matter. I could overcome it if I was committed to do so and there was scientific evidence to prove it.</p>
          <p>What intrigued me the most was actually the grit scale test. On a scale of 0.0 to 5.0, my grit score was 3.20. Which means I scored higher than about 30% of American adults. Based on the questions asked, I discovered that I’m incredibly persistent but need to work on my focus.</p>
          <p>To find out where you fall on the grit scale <a href="https://angeladuckworth.com/grit-scale/">take the grit scale test.</a></p>
