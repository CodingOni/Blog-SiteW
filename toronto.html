                      <h2  class="section-heading">1</h2>
                      <p>First, let’s start off with why this trip was important. So I have a couple travel-related items on my bucket list and one of these travel-related items was to visit Toronto. With all of the exotic or faraway places I could choose to add to the list, one might think “why Toronto?” I’m not sure when I heard about Caribana, Toronto’s annual Caribbean carnival, but I heard that it was North America's largest carnival festival. It sounded like something I just had to experience. I’m also not sure what kept me from actually planning a trip all these years given the quick and relatively inexpensive flight costs from New York or Miami, but I just never did.</p>
                      <p>Something happened this year though. This year has been a year of speaking things into existence. Earlier this year in the midst of various other trips and responsibilities and juggling of my budget, I spoke out loud “I’m going to Caribana this year.” I didn’t know which line item of the budget it was coming from (I run a tight ship when it comes to my budget), and I didn’t know who I would go with (I never travel alone) and I didn’t know if I would have enough days off (I had already planned to max out my allotted PTO days).</p>
                      <p>In the middle of this year during one of our routine chats, my cousin Marguerite informs me that she’s going to Caribana with a group of our cousins. She isn’t really the hardcore Soca music loving, partying type so I was shocked when she told me she was playing mas. If you’re unfamiliar with Caribbean carnivals, playing mas means to participate in costume as a masquerader.  The parade itself is compiled of a collection of large groups called bands and each band will have several sections of masqueraders with individual costume themes.</p>
                      <p>After confirming Marguerite was dead serious I with no hesitation said, “I’m coming too.” With no shame I invited myself and my bestie, E along on this trip. Within days I had ordered my costume and purchased my flight. The band we would participate with was called Carnival Nationz and our section (1 of 14) was called Empower. I happened to have a little extra in discretionary funds that I used for the costume and used mileage from my card to purchase airfare. In the meantime two of my other trips were canceled freeing up some more funds for my Caribana experience.</p>
                      <p>As for the trip, it started off smoothly for me but not so much for Marguerite and E who I had planned to meet up with at the Toronto Pearson Airport since we all would land within an hour of each one another. When I realized that we would be cutting it close for costume pickup cut off, I told them I would go ahead and they could meet me at Mas Camp (Every band has their own mas camp. This is essentially ground zero for each band). When I landed I discovered a string of messages about flights being delayed. Marguerite’s delayed by and hour and E’s delayed by several hours. She wouldn’t be in until two in the morning. By the time I picked up my costume and E’s (One of my cousins had already picked up Marguerites) Marguerite had landed. We decided to meet up at our Air bnb. Later that night while out at dinner with family we discovered that E’s flight was delayed until 12pm the next day not 12 am. After some calls and searches to try and figure something out she decided not to come (Huge bummer and blow to the trip since E’s is the life of the party).</p>
                      <p>The following morning we made our way out for some quick breakfast and then back up to get ready. We took forever to get ready but were really happy with our makeup and overall looks. We headed out without knowing exactly where we were headed but figured it out eventually. The parade route, which commenced at Exhibition Center was fairly close to where we were staying which was great.</p>
                      <p>We met up with our group and quickly got the party started. We embraced, took a gang of pictures, shared some drinks and hit “di road”. We were initially concerned about the weather possibly being cold and rainy but that couldn’t have been further from the truth. It was hot. It was blazing hot. We were all drenched with sweat as we danced and carried on but it was a blast.</p>
                      <p>Having participated in Miami Carnival once, I had an inclination of what to expect but there were clear differences. Miami is much smaller but also much more organized. There was a point during Caribana where we literally were concerned for our lives. In an effort to keep “stormers” (those who did not pay to participate in costume) from jumping into the crowd of masqueraders, they opened a large gate for the truck we were following to go through but quickly shut it leaving us in a crowd of aggressive people all trying to shove and push their way through. We were actually afraid someone might get trampled but eventually, we made it through.</p>
                      <p>Overall, I’ll wrap up my experience in a list of positives and negatives.</p>
                      <p><strong>Positives:</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                      <li>Meeting new family members and carrying on with them</li>
                      <li>Our band provided snacks and meals and water to masqueraders</li>
                      <li>I loved our section's costumes. They were beautiful.</li>
                      <li>My cousin, a hockey fan, got to meet hockey player P.K. Subban</li>
                      <li>After several hours some songs replayed multiple times but for the most part the music was great.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p><strong>Negatives:</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                      <li>It was disorganized. There was no crowd control. The band marshals did essentially nothing.</li>
                      <li>There were long wait times along the route and before crossing the stage to be judged.</li>
                      <li>Although food was provided, scores of masqueraders became sick from it. Luckily we didn’t.</li>
                      <li>They eventually ran out of water before we crossed the stage and people began fainting</li>
                      <li>Unlike Miami, the judging area was actually not an elevated stage, just a judging section at the end of the route.</li>
                      <li>Unlike Miami, bands do not provide alcohol to masqueraders. Caribana is BYOB</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>All in all it was a great trip. After Caribana Marguerite and I skipped going out to party and went out and had a delicious late night dinner at Cactus Club Café instead. Some of our cousins had planned to attend an event with Soca legend, Machel Montano but the event had its permit revoked for some unknown reason. There was chatter about how the promoters had done everything right and the city not respecting how much revenue Caribana brings to town. I don’t know much about the history behind that to comment. We made our way back to our hotel completely exhausted, battered and bruised. The next day we rounded off our trip with brunch, a visit to the CN tower, and a family barbecue.</p>
                        <p>Toronto is a great city. Would I come back to Caribana? Maybe. I’m not sure but I could definitely see myself coming back to Toronto though. Glad I got to check this one off the bucket list in this fashion. Even with the negatives, I had a great time.</p>
